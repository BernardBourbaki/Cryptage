# Cryptage V37.2

**Secure encryption for text files and images**

## 🔐 Security

* **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)
* **Key derivation**: Argon2id (GPU-resistant)
* **Integrity**: GCM authentication tag
* **Format**: .crypt (proprietary but open specification)

## ⚠️ Important

### Version compatibility

* **V37 / V37.1 / V37.2**: Decrypts **ONLY** .crypt files created with V37+
* **V31-V36**: Use [Cryptage V36.1](https://github.com/BernardBourbaki/Cryptage/releases/tag/v36.1) to decrypt old files

### Limits

* **Maximum size**: 10 MB per file
* **Supported formats**:
  * Text: .txt
  * Images: .jpg, .png, .bmp
  * Encrypted: .crypt
* **Password**: No recovery possible - **use a password manager**

## 🚀 Installation

### Windows (Executable)

1. Download Cryptage_V37.2.exe from [Releases](https://github.com/BernardBourbaki/Cryptage/releases/latest)
2. Verify SHA256 checksum (see checksums.txt)
3. Run the executable (no installation required)

### Build from sources

**Requirements**:

* GCC (MinGW-w64 for Windows)
* OpenSSL 3.0+

**Command**:
gcc -o Cryptage_V37.2.exe Cryptage_Main.c Cryptage_Core.c Cryptage_UI_Common.c Cryptage_UI.c -lssl -lcrypto -lgdi32 -lcomctl32 -mwindows


## 📖 Usage

### Intuitive 3-step interface

#### To encrypt a file

1. **Create a strong password** (16+ characters recommended)
   * Use KeePass, Bitwarden or another manager
   * ⚠️ Never send the password with the encrypted file
2. **IMPORT** → **ENCRYPT** → **SAVE**
   * Click "IMPORT" and select your file
   * Click "ENCRYPT"
   * Click "SAVE" to create the .crypt file

#### To decrypt a file

1. **Enter the password** used for encryption
2. **IMPORT** → **DECRYPT** → **EXPORT**
   * Click "IMPORT" and select the .crypt file
   * Click "DECRYPT"
   * Click "EXPORT" (Text or Image depending on content)

### "Quick start" panel

Click the button at the bottom of the window to show/hide detailed instructions (fully visible in V37.1).

## 🔒 Security best practices

✅ **DO**:

* Use passwords of at least 16 characters
* Store passwords in a secure manager
* Test decryption **before** deleting the original
* Keep multiple copies of Cryptage_V37.2.exe

❌ **DO NOT**:

* Send the password AND encrypted file via the same channel
* Use the same password for all files
* Forget to verify decryption works
* Delete the original before testing

## 🛠️ Technical parameters

### Automatic configuration

The software automatically calculates the optimal memory parameter:

* **Formula**: 25% of available RAM
* **Minimum**: 4 MB (4096 KiB)
* **Maximum**: 1024 MB (1048576 KiB)
* **Default**: 16 MB if calculation fails

## 📊 What's new in V37.2 (August 9, 2026)

### Fixes (V37.2)

- 🐛 Fixed a possible out-of-bounds read when decrypting a truncated or corrupted .crypt file
- 🐛 Fixed a one-byte overflow during memory cleanup after encryption
- 🐛 Fixed a memory leak on image import (JPG/PNG/BMP)
- 🐛 Fixed a possible crash when closing the app while an operation is in progress
- 🐛 Fixed a GDI handle leak when redrawing buttons
- 🔧 Cleaned up a poorly-defined reserved area in the .crypt file header (no impact on existing files, format unchanged)
